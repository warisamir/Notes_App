# Notify
## Overview
An app to organize notes into unique groups, allowing users to create custom groups and associate relevant notes with each group.

## Reason to create this App?
Most notes app create individual notes but often times we may need to create notes that are relevant to a single topic, say your physics assignment notes. You may need to create different type of notes related to the assignment so creating a single group where all these different notes can be stored is where Notify comes in.

## Features
* Create a new group which opens a pop-up where user writes the name of group and chooses a color associated with group.
* The new group is displayed on sidebar by clicking on which the notes box is shown where you can write all the notes associated within the group in order of date and time.
* After Creating another group, you can now toggle between the groups and relevant notes will be displayed.
